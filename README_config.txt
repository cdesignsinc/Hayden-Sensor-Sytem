MOTE_ID(up to 9 alphanumerics),K_TYPE,EC Calibration Value(no commas or decimals),SENSOR READ DELAY(seconds),CAL ROUTINE (Y or N),DEPTH MEASURE (Y or N),FLUID DENSITY(number value, can have decimals)

Example:

HS001,1.0,1413,900,n,y,997

Mote ID: HS001
K-Type of EC Probe: 1.0
Solution to cal EC probe to: 1413
Delay between reads in seconds: 900 (15 mins)
Run Cal routine: n (no)
Depth Measure: y (yes)
Fluid Density: 997 (fluid density of fresh water)
